# CPandFriends

Welcome to the Playground. If you're in this repo, you more or less have some
interest in learning a thing or two about Coding/Web Development. This will essentially
be a place for us to come together, come up with some stupid or awesome projects to work on, and
help each other improve in areas they're interested in.


My vision for this is simple. Do cool shit and have fun. You have an Idea for something you want to work on, ideally we'll help you realize it (Note, I'm pretty sure everyone bar Pat is Junior Dev).  Don't have a cool idea? Not a problem, I'm loaded with stupid ideas for apps/software no-ones asked for. So if you're just in for the ride to practice coding skills with some kind of direction, also a good place to be.

## Possible App ideas:
-  CPandFriends do Glorified Grocery List
-  CPandFriends do Beer
-  CPandFriends do Virtual Office
-  CPandFriends do Fitness Games

## Starting:
